    abstract = "{As the largest radio telescope in the world, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will lead the next generation of radio astronomy. The feats of engineering required to construct the telescope array will be matched only by the techniques developed to exploit the rich scientific value of the data. To drive forward the development of efficient and accurate analysis methods, we are designing a series of data challenges that will provide the scientific community with high-quality data sets for testing and evaluating new techniques. In this paper, we present a description and results from the first such Science Data Challenge 1 (SDC1). Based on SKA MID continuum simulated observations and covering three frequencies (560, 1400, and 9200Â MHz) at three depths (8, 100, and 1000â€‰h), SDC1 asked participants to apply source detection, characterization, and classification methods to simulated data. The challenge opened in 2018 November, with nine teams submitting results by the deadline of 2019 April. In this work, we analyse the results for eight of those teams, showcasing the variety of approaches that can be successfully used to find, characterize, and classify sources in a deep, crowded field. The results also demonstrate the importance of building domain knowledge and expertise on this kind of analysis to obtain the best performance. As high-resolution observations begin revealing the true complexity of the sky, one of the outstanding challenges emerging from this analysis is the ability to deal with highly resolved and complex sources as effectively as the unresolved source population.}",

	abstract = {The Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) is a synoptic, all-sky radio sky survey with a unique combination of high angular resolution (≈2.″5), sensitivity (a 1σ goal of 70 μJy/beam in the coadded data), full linear Stokes polarimetry, time domain coverage, and wide bandwidth (2–4 GHz). The first observations began in 2017 September, and observing for the survey will finish in 2024. VLASS will use approximately 5500 hr of time on the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to cover the whole sky visible to the VLA (decl. > −40°), a total of 33 885 deg. The data will be taken in three epochs to allow the discovery of variable and transient radio sources. The survey is designed to engage radio astronomy experts, multi-wavelength astronomers, and citizen scientists alike. By utilizing an “on the fly” interferometry mode, the observing overheads are much reduced compared to a conventional pointed survey. In this paper, we present the science case and observational strategy for the survey, and also results from early survey observations.}

    abstract = "{We present the clustering properties of a complete sample of 968 radio sources detected at 1.4 GHz by the Very Large Array (VLA)-COSMOS survey with radio fluxes brighter than 0.15 mJy. 92 per cent have redshift determinations from the Laigle et al. catalogue. Based on their radio luminosity, these objects have been divided into 644 AGN and 247 star-forming galaxies. By fixing the slope of the autocorrelation function to γ = 2, we find \\$r\_0=11.7^\\{+1.0\\}\_\\{-1.1\\}\\$ Mpc for the clustering length of the whole sample, while \\$r\_0=11.2^\\{+2.5\\}\_\\{-3.3\\}\\$ Mpc and \\$r\_0=7.8^\\{+1.6\\}\_\\{-2.1\\}\\$ Mpc (\\$r\_0=6.8^\\{+1.4\\}\_\\{-1.8\\}\\$ Mpc for z ≤ 0.9) are, respectively, obtained for AGN and star-forming galaxies. These values correspond to minimum masses for dark matter haloes of \\$M\_\\{\\rm min\\}=10^\\{13.6^\\{+0.3\\}\_\\{-0.6\\}\\}\\$ M⊙ for radio-selected AGN and \\$M\_\\{\\rm min\\}=10^\\{13.1^\\{+0.4\\}\_\\{-1.6\\}\\}\\$ M⊙ for radio-emitting star-forming galaxies (\\$M\_\\{\\rm min\\}=10^\\{12.7^\\{+0.7\\}\_\\{-2.2\\}\\}\\$ M⊙ for z ≤ 0.9). Comparisons with previous works imply an independence of the clustering properties of the AGN population with respect to both radio luminosity and redshift. We also investigate the relationship between dark and luminous matter in both populations. We obtain 〈M*〉/Mhalo ≲ 10− 2.7 for AGN, and 〈M*〉/Mhalo ≲ 10− 2.4 in the case of star-forming galaxies. Furthermore, if we restrict to z ≲ 0.9 star-forming galaxies, we derive 〈M*〉/Mhalo ≲ 10− 2.1, result that clearly shows the cosmic process of stellar build-up as one moves towards the more local universe. Comparisons between the observed space density of radio-selected AGN and that of dark matter haloes show that about one in two haloes is associated with a black hole in its radio-active phase. This suggests that the radio-active phase is a recurrent phenomenon.}",
